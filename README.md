# 中文 Zhongwen-android - A Chinese-English Pop-Up Dictionary

This browser extension allows you to translate Chinese characters and words
by simply clicking on them.

It is a port to Firefox on Android of the (desktop) Firefox extension of Leonard Lausen (https://github.com/leezu/zhongwen) which itself is a port of the Chrome extension of Christian Schiller (https://github.com/cschiller/zhongwen).

*Note: currently chrome does not support extension on android devices.*

## Highlights
- Supports both traditional and simplified characters.
- Includes a recent version of the widely used CEDICT Chinese English
  dictionary.
- As a learning aid it uses different colors for displaying the Pinyin
  syllables, depending on the tone of the Chinese character.
- Highlights the characters whose translation is displayed in the pop-up
  window.
- Some Zhongwen extension laptop features are currently not supported: interfacte to Skritter/grammar/vocabulary list.
 


## Installation

On your android device, open firefox go to https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/ and search for zhongwen-android.


## How Does It Work?
Once Zhongwen is installed on your android device you can directly use it if you browse to a page containing chinese character and press on one of those. The popup will show up and be displayed for 4 seconds (configurable). You can also make the popup disappear by clicking on it.
If you want to turn the extension off, click on the top right of the firefox window and goto the addons configuration, there you can turn on/off each addon.


## What Information Does It Show?
By default, the pop-up window shows the following pieces of information:

- the Chinese charaters forming the word you're touching.  
- the corresponding Pinyin. The individual Pinyin syllables are shown in different
  colors (see below).
- the English translation. Sometimes, Zhongwen finds more than one matching entry 
  in its dictionary. In this case it shows you all of the matching entries.


## Zhuyin
If you want to see Zhuyin, a.k.a. Bopomofo, you can enable it via the options
page (see below).


## Why Is Pinyin Shown in Different Colors?
If you're learning Chinese, Zhongwen helps you remember the tone of each
character by displaying it in a different color. It uses the following color
scheme for showing Pinying syllables:

- First tone syllables are shown in red.
- Second tone syllables are shown in orange.
- Third tone syllables are shown in green.
- Forth tone syllables are shown in blue.

  
 

## What Built-In Dictionary Does It Use?
Zhongwen comes with a recent release of the CC-CEDICT dictionary. This dictionary is
constantly updated, and each Zhongwen release will include an updated version of the
dictionary.
